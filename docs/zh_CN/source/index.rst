Ola Language
==================================

Ola is influenced by Solidity, Rust . very easy for developers familiar with solidity and rust to get started, It is statically typed, supports complex user-defined types among other features.
With Ola you can create contracts for a variety of uses

The current ola language is unstable and has many features that need to be improved, so keep an eye on our progress!
