# Smart contracts

Ola contracts allow users to write complex business logic that will be deployed to ola's l2 network, 
and cross-contract calls can be written between different contracts just like solidity

## Examples 

### 


````javascript

contract Fib {
    u32 const a = 10;
    fn fib(u32 num) -> {
        
    }
    
}

````
